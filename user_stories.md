## User Stories

### Susan

Susan is a young entrepreneur. She has an ecommerce site and wants to know her user base. She want to get basic analytics about the visitors to her site, when they visit, where they are visiting from and how much engagement on her site. All without learning a new technology

### Tom

Tom writes a travel blog, but is hosting it on his own site. He wants to know which articles people are reading, how long they are taking, and what demographics the users are.

### Liza

Liza is the CEO of a 4 person startup. She doesn't have the funds to hiring a marketer yet, but wants to do A/B user testing. She wants to compare the number of users, how much time users are taking before they click away and click to continue.

### Omar

Omar is a marketing director for a small social media operation. He not only wants to know his users, but wants to know why types of engagements they are making with the site. Are posts coming from other sources, are they being shared elsewhere, or are they locally sourced? He wants to know what trends are being talked about. He would also like to know what passive interactions with the site in the site lead to active changes on the site.

## User Packages

Susan and Tom would likely find the *freemium* Pixie Package to best fit their needs. This package would require them to put exactly two lines of code into their file, a script tag and a secret key. They would come to Pixie's site and be greeting with a single page application showing their site's analytics. Susan in time may progress into wanting a more complex package, but for the time being Tom and Susan should be satisfied with the information they are retreiving from the site.

Liza would be interested in the Manic Pixie package, which would allow her to compare the data from her application over multiple factors. It would require deeper integration of the software with her site, most of which can be done through the online interface.

Omar would find the Dream Girl package most suited to his needs. The dream girl package would involve a high level of site itegration completed through the online interface and through the communication of his database with the pixie servers.

The online interface for all packages is a sleek, simple design which is easy and intutive. The freemium packages require little to no programming experience, and the development knowledge needed for the Manic Pixie and the Dream Girl packages is low, and well documented.
