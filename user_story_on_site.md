## What does a User experience when they get to Pixie Report?

### On arrival

 - If already signed in, a user will be directly brought to their personal page, where they can see the list of the projects they are already using.
 - If they are not signed in they are prompted to do so, sign up, or check out a demo.

### Using the application

A Pixie user will be shown 4-6 frames of analytics all accessible on a single page. The following information will in some form be available:

 - geolocation of users
 - Unique and repeat users
 - time spent on page and interactions
 - links clicked on taking them away from the page
 - time of day and day of week analytics
 - open to suggestion

These frames will be readable without further clicking, but some may have further analytical ability, potentially a scalable time frame, and degree of detail that is adjustable

### When they upgrade

Pixie users will be walked through a process with specific table names in their database, they will be able to focus on interactions on a specific portion of the page, and heatmaps for user interaction will be in more refined detail. Manuals will be fully fleshed out so a beginner level fullstack programmer will be able to implement the tools and connect.

## Key Goals:

A user will not have to learn a new technology in order to implement or understand the data that is received from pixie report.
